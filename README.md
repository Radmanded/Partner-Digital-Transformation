<summary>Automation History</summary>

  
Automation, the application of machines to tasks once
performed by human beings or, increasingly, to tasks
that would otherwise be impossible. Although the term
mechanization is often used to refer to the simple
replacement of human labour by machines, automation
generally implies the integration of machines into a self
governing system. Automation has revolutionized those
areas in which it has been introduced, and there is
scarcely an aspect of modern life that has been
unaffected by it.
The term automation was coined in the automobile
industry about 1946 to describe the increased use of
automatic devices and controls in mechanized
production lines. The origin of the word is attributed to
D.S. Harder, an engineering manager at the Ford Motor
Company at the time.
